# About me
* Hello, this is Saketh Bachu, and I am a graduate student at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). I am also a part of the [Vision and Learning Group](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/) (Advised by Prof. Amit Roy Chowdhury).	

* The topics of my interest include: Large Multimodal Models, Deep learning, Computer vision, and Mathematics.

* I am very keen on following research that is being done on the above mentioned fields, and the practical usage of the research excites me.

* I tried to solve a couple of real-life problems with the help of my fields of interest and more information can be gathered from my repositories.
